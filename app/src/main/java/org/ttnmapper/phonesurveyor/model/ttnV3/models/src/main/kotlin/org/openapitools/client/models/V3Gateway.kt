/**
 * Gateway is the message that defines a gateway on the network.
 *
 * @param ids 
 * @param createdAt When the gateway was created. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network.
 * @param updatedAt When the gateway was last updated. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network.
 * @param deletedAt When the gateway was deleted. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network.
 * @param name The name of the gateway. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network.
 * @param description A description for the gateway. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network.
 * @param attributes Key-value attributes for this gateway. Typically used for organizing gateways or for storing integration-specific data.
 * @param contactInfo Contact information for this gateway. Typically used to indicate who to contact with technical/security questions about the gateway.
 * @param versionIds 
 * @param gatewayServerAddress The address of the Gateway Server to connect to. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network if status_public is true. The typical format of the address is \"scheme://host:port\". The scheme is optional. If the port is omitted, the normal port inference (with DNS lookup, otherwise defaults) is used. The connection shall be established with transport layer security (TLS). Custom certificate authorities may be configured out-of-band.
 * @param autoUpdate 
 * @param updateChannel 
 * @param frequencyPlanId Frequency plan ID of the gateway. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network. DEPRECATED: use frequency_plan_ids. This equals the first element of the frequency_plan_ids field.
 * @param frequencyPlanIds Frequency plan IDs of the gateway. This information is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network. The first element equals the frequency_plan_id field.
 * @param antennas Antennas of the gateway. Location information of the antennas is public and can be seen by any authenticated user in the network if location_public=true.
 * @param statusPublic The status of this gateway may be publicly displayed.
 * @param locationPublic The location of this gateway may be publicly displayed.
 * @param scheduleDownlinkLate Enable server-side buffering of downlink messages. This is recommended for gateways using the Semtech UDP Packet Forwarder v2.x or older, as it does not feature a just-in-time queue. If enabled, the Gateway Server schedules the downlink message late to the gateway so that it does not overwrite previously scheduled downlink messages that have not been transmitted yet.
 * @param enforceDutyCycle Enforcing gateway duty cycle is recommended for all gateways to respect spectrum regulations. Disable enforcing the duty cycle only in controlled research and development environments.
 * @param downlinkPathConstraint 
 * @param scheduleAnytimeDelay Adjust the time that GS schedules class C messages in advance. This is useful for gateways that have a known high latency backhaul, like 3G and satellite.
 * @param updateLocationFromStatus Update the location of this gateway from status messages. This only works for gateways connecting with authentication; gateways connected over UDP are not supported.
 * @param lbsLnsSecret 
 * @param claimAuthenticationCode 
 * @param targetCupsUri CUPS URI for LoRa Basics Station CUPS redirection. The CUPS Trust field will be automatically fetched from the cert chain presented by the target server.
 * @param targetCupsKey 
 * @param requireAuthenticatedConnection Require an authenticated gateway connection. This prevents the gateway from using the UDP protocol and requires authentication when using other protocols.
 * @param lrfhss 
 * @param disablePacketBrokerForwarding
